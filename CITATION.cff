abstract: >-
  CASCADE is an MCP server for in silico gene perturbation analysis
  in cancer and immuno-oncology research. It provides 22 tools for
  simulating gene knockdowns and overexpression using pre-computed
  regulatory networks and GREmLN model embeddings across 10 immune
  and epithelial cell types, with LangGraph-based workflow
  orchestration for intelligent, automated analysis pipelines.
