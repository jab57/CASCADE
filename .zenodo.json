  "title": "CASCADE: Computational Analysis of Simulated Cell And Drug Effects",
  "description": "CASCADE is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for in silico gene perturbation analysis in cancer and immuno-oncology research. It provides 22 tools for simulating gene knockdowns and overexpression using pre-computed regulatory networks and GREmLN model embeddings across 10 immune and epithelial cell types. Features LangGraph-based workflow orchestration with intelligent routing, parallel batch execution, and optional LLM-powered biological interpretation via Ollama.",
